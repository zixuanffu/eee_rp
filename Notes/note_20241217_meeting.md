# Meeting with Olivier

## Background
1. Dynamic pricing exists. How about dynamic choice of purchase?
2. Durable goods (car (not exactly dynamic programing), solar panel) where the choice when to buy and replace.
3. Durable goods (detergent, coca cola, things that last long) where the choice is how many to buy and when to buy.
4. Perishable goods (event ticket, transport ticket, the value of which will be zero after a certain point in time) where the choice is when to buy. 
For firms, the price of tickets depend on demand (willingness to pay of consumers), the inventory left (scarcity effect, opportunity cost of selling one seat.)

## Reference papers
1. Dynamic model of housing supply A. Murphy
2. Train textbook. The variance of utility shock at two cities can be different and identified as well. 

## Suggestion
1. Price coefficient: accounting for selection (what kinds of consumers come at what time) in the model, within period decision (buy or not buy) will identify the price coefficient.
2. Other parameters: the time dynamics will identify other parameters (like risk aversion, waiting cost, etc.)
3. The uncertainty in plan: the expectation for future plan differs across travelers and differ across time. 
4. The dynamics in price: the expectation for price differs across time (and may differ across travelers?)
5. How to motivate the model: why do you want a model on the consumer side? What kind of counterfactual would you like to do? For example, the extreme where firms do not adopt dynamic pricing (all consumers are not aware of dynamic pricing), or consumer change their expectation/firm change their recommendation, consumers are all certain about the future, etc.
6. Start by thinking about 3-4 period model and a binary decision.
7. The difference between optimal stopping problem (there's no replacement and resell value of the equipment, for example the solar panel, the car, the housing supply) and the inventory problem (bus replacement, patent renewal, stockpiling).
