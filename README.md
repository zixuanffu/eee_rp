## Abstract

Dynamic pricing strategies are widely employed in markets with perishable inventories, such as airlines and entertainment events, to optimize revenue. Previous studies have focused on firm-side pricing strategies under the assumption that consumer arrivals follow a Poisson process with time-varying willingness to pay and price elasticity. However, this paper investigates the consumer perspective, particularly the intertemporal decision-making process of travelers. Travelers often balance the trade-off between minimizing costs and reducing uncertainty, forming price expectations based on observed dynamics before making purchase decisions. This behavior can be modeled as an optimal stopping problem, capturing how consumers decide when to buy tickets.
